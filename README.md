# First Django App ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
## Avoiding Tutorial Hell
I have often heard of the existence of tutorial hell. I plan to avoid it all costs. But yes this is essentially the DjangoTutorial for a blog app. 
In order to avoid any sort of hell - I plan to touch base on what I learn with each upcoming commit. Making my own descriptions of what I am doing. 
Thank you for taking part of this journey!
